Description: This package allows the user to estimate treatment effects in 
    panel environments. The package currently implements a shared factor modelling approach 
    which allows for estimation of regression type equations under full posterior 
    inference. Upcoming is a switching regression modelling approach.
	These models are helpful to deal with correlation between preset factors of the subjects
	as well as correlation structures in panel outcome.
