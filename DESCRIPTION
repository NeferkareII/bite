Description: This package allows the user to estimate treatment effects in difficult 
    panel environments. The package currently a shared factor modelling approach 
    which allows for estimation of regression type equations under full posterior 
    inference. Coming up will be a switching regression model framework which
    allows for estimation of panel data treatment effects under Roy Model.
